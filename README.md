**Catalyst** is an PyTorch framework for Deep Learning research and development.
It was developed with a focus on reproducibility, fast experimentation and code/ideas reusing.
Being able to research/develop something new, rather than write another regular train loop. <br/>
Break the cycle - use the Catalyst!
